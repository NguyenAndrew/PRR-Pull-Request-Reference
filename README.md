## 3. Reviewers

### 3.1 Comment Labels

As a reviewer, when making a comment that is not a reply, you must include one of the **standard** "Comment Labels". These "Comment Labels" quickly indicates to others how well a pull request is going. Here are the following **standard** "Comment Labels":

* `Discussion:` - Something that the reviewer wants to talk about with others. Does not impact approval.
* `Recommendation:` - A change recommended by the reviewer. Does not impact approval
* `Minor:` - Indicating an issue with the pull request. The pull request is not going to be approved, untill this minor issue is resolved. 
* `Major:` - Indicating a major issue with the pull request. The reviewer is going to mark the pull request as "changes request", untill this major issue is resolved.
